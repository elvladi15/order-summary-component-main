## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is my first Frontent Mentor project, and it was a good experience writing plain HTML and CSS again after a long time. I used everything I remembered from HTML and CSS, but I think the code can improve.

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to expand my knowledge in HTML and CSS so that I can improve my UIs and be a better frontend developer!
